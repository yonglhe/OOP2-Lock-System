# Lock system in Qt Creator (Dutch)

This assignment is part of my second-year HBO-ICT program at The Hague University of Applied Sciences (HHS). 
It is for the course "Object-Oriented Programming." The project involves creating a lock system built in Qt Creator using C++. 
The system includes two rotating doors and a sliding door, each can equipped with a unique type of lock, such as a password, code, or recognition system lock.
